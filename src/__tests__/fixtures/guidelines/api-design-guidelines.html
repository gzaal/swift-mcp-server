  <h1>Swift API Design Guidelines</h1>

  <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
  <p>Clarity at the point of use is your most important goal. Code is read far more often than it is written.</p>

  <h2>Naming</h2>
  <p>Promote clear usage. Name variables, parameters, and associated types according to their roles.</p>
  <p>Prefer method and function names that make use sites form grammatical English phrases.</p>

  <h2>Conventions</h2>
  <p>Follow case conventions. Names of types and protocols are UpperCamelCase. Everything else is lowerCamelCase.</p>
  <p>Acronyms should be uniformly upper or lower case. Use HTTPRequest, not HttpRequest.</p>

  <h2>Special Instructions</h2>
  <p>Document the complexity of any computed property that is not O(1).</p>
